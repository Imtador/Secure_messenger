---

## 🔹 PHASE 1. Server Core, Database, and Authentication

### Tasks
- Create project structure, initialize repository, configure dependencies.
- Deploy HTTP server with basic routes (`/health`, `/api/auth/*`).
- Connect database (PostgreSQL) and cache (Redis); create schemas: `users`, `contacts`, `chats`, `chat_members`, `messages`, `attachments`, `chat_keys`.
- Implement registration with ECDH public key submission.
- Implement authentication with input validation and token issuance.
- Configure secure password storage (Argon2id) and JWT management (access + refresh).
- Implement user profile retrieval and updates.
- save progress of project with version control tool as git

### Requirements
- RESTful API, JSON responses, standard HTTP status codes.
- Password hashing: Argon2id.
- Authentication: JWT (short-lived access + refresh) or HTTP-only cookies.
- Field validation: length, format, username/email uniqueness.
- Errors handled centrally; internal server details are not exposed.
- Client generates ECDH key pair on registration; public key stored on server, private key encrypted with password (PBKDF2 + AES-256-GCM) and stored in browser IndexedDB.
- working version control

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- User can register and receive a token/session.
- Data is persisted to the database; passwords are not stored in plaintext.
- API responds correctly to valid and invalid requests.
- ECDH key pair generated; public key on server, encrypted private key in IndexedDB.

## 🔹 PHASE 2. Contacts and Chat Management

### Tasks
- Implement user search by username/display name.
- Implement contact management: send request, accept/reject, remove, list contacts.
- Implement 1-to-1 chat creation (create or return existing).
- Implement chat listing with last message preview and unread count.
- Derive shared encryption key for 1-to-1 chats via ECDH (private key + recipient's public key).

### Requirements
- Contact requests are bidirectional; status tracking (pending, accepted, blocked).
- Duplicate 1-to-1 chat creation returns the existing chat.
- Chat list sorted by last message timestamp.
- Shared secret derived via ECDH; AES-256-GCM key established for each 1-to-1 chat.
- Server never has access to the derived encryption key.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Full contact lifecycle works: request → accept → appear in list → remove.
- 1-to-1 chat created between two users; duplicate creation returns same chat.
- Chat list displays correctly with previews and unread counts.
- ECDH shared secret derived correctly on both clients independently.

## 🔹 PHASE 3. Real-time Messaging and Encryption

### Tasks
- Integrate WebSocket transport (Socket.IO).
- Implement WebSocket authentication (token verification during handshake).
- Implement room logic: join `user:{id}` and `chat:{chatId}`, broadcast by chat_id.
- Configure saving each encrypted message to the database before broadcasting.
- Implement loading of the last 50 messages upon entering a chat (cursor pagination).
- Implement client-side message encryption/decryption (AES-256-GCM).
- Add heartbeat, reconnection logic, and online status indicators.
- Implement offline message queue (Redis); deliver pending messages on reconnect.
- Implement typing indicators and read receipts.

### Requirements
- Message format: `{ id, chat_id, sender_id, content_encrypted, content_iv, content_tag, message_type, reply_to, created_at }`.
- Messages encrypted client-side before transmission; server stores only ciphertext.
- Guaranteed delivery within an active session; pending messages delivered on reconnect.
- Automatic client reconnection on connection drop.
- History limit: 50 messages per request; cursor-based pagination.
- Statuses: online (connected), offline (disconnected >30 sec).
- Typing indicators throttled (1 event per 3 seconds).
- Read receipts update `last_read_message_id` in `chat_members`.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Two clients in the same chat exchange encrypted messages in real time.
- Messages are unreadable in the database; decrypt correctly on the receiver side.
- Upon re-entry, history loads correctly; no duplicate messages.
- User statuses update accurately.
- Offline users receive all missed messages upon reconnection.
- Typing indicators and read receipts function correctly.

## 🔹 PHASE 4. Group Chats and Key Management

### Tasks
- Implement group chat creation with member selection.
- Implement group key generation and distribution (random AES-256 key encrypted with each member's public key).
- Implement member management: add, remove, change roles (owner, admin, member).
- Implement key rotation on membership changes (new AES key, increment version).
- Implement group metadata updates (name, description, avatar).
- Implement leaving a group (require owner transfer if last owner).
- Generate system messages for membership events ("X added Y", "Y left").

### Requirements
- Group chat key encrypted individually for each member; stored in `chat_keys` table.
- Key rotation mandatory on member add (new member can't read old messages) and member remove (removed member can't read new messages).
- Role hierarchy: owner > admin > member. Cannot remove last owner.
- System messages generated automatically for join/leave/role change events.
- All key operations performed client-side; server only stores encrypted keys.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Group created with all members receiving encrypted chat keys.
- Removed member cannot decrypt new messages; new member cannot decrypt old messages.
- Role changes enforced correctly; last owner cannot leave without transfer.
- System messages appear for all membership events.

## 🔹 PHASE 5. File Transfer and Media

### Tasks
- Implement presigned URL generation for direct upload to MinIO (S3-compatible storage).
- Implement client-side file encryption (random AES-256 key per file, encrypt before upload).
- Implement file key encryption with chat key; store in `attachments` table.
- Implement file download with client-side decryption.
- Implement image thumbnail generation, encryption, and storage.
- Configure file limits and validation (size, MIME types, user quota).

### Requirements
- Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, WEBP, GIF, PDF, common document formats.
- File size limit: up to 100 MB.
- User quota: 1 GB per user.
- Secure filename handling (UUID; block executable extensions).
- Asynchronous upload/download without blocking the UI.
- File encryption key encrypted with the chat's symmetric key; stored in database.
- Thumbnails encrypted with the same file key.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Files upload, save, and display correctly in chat.
- Uploaded files are unreadable in storage without the decryption key.
- Files download and decrypt correctly on the receiving client.
- Limits and validation work; upload errors are handled gracefully.
- Image thumbnails display in chat; full image available on click.

- Implement message rendering (timestamp, author, scroll, "mine/others" distinction, encryption status).
- Implement contact management UI: search, add, accept/reject, list.
- Implement group chat UI: creation, member management, role assignment.
- Implement file upload UI: drag-drop, progress bar, attachment display.
- Configure network state handling: disconnect, reconnect, outbound message queue.
- Add basic UX elements: auto-scroll, input focus, loading indicator, responsive layout.

### Requirements
- Responsive layout (mobile + desktop).
- No blocking operations during send/receive.
- Client-side input validation (empty messages, special characters).
